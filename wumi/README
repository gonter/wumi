WUMI

A sendmail Milter written in Python. It calls an external virus
scanner and blocks email attachments of certain kinds. Thus your
Mailserver does not have to send nonsense bounces anymore.

The software is a sendmail milter, written in python. It is
plugin - enabled and tests the mail content after the remote
server finished the SMTP "DATA" step. At this place wumi is able
to reject a mail. The server has seen it, but refuses to deliver
it. Thus we do not need to send bounces (to faked adresses!) nor
do out users have to deal with nonsense mails (like "our virus
scanner removed the attachment" or the like).

We at wu-wien.ac.at plan to include a bayes-based plugin in this
software, so we will be able to reject spam *during the initial
smtp connection*.

The software is in production use at wu-wien.ac.at, you can test
the behavior by e.g. sending an ".exe" attachment to
postmaster@wu-wien.ac.at. Our mailserver will block this, and you
will see how the software works.

Have fun,
