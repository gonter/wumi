Check Run Dependencies:
-----------------------

-) A stable python installation, currently I recommend python 2.2
   or python 2.3.4

-) The python-milter python module as python interface to
   sendmails libmilter: <http://bmsi.com/python/>

-) McAffees "uvscan" Virus Scanner from "Networks Associates". A
   one-host license is about $8 per year. It is available for most
   contemporary Unix Platforms, it runs at least on:

   FreeBSD          
   HP-UX            
   IBM AIX          
   Linux            
   SCO OpenServer
   Sun Solaris   
   Linux/390   

-) agettok is a Program used at our place to print passwords -
   The password should be the same for all the milterservers
   collaborating in one domain. It can easily be replaced by agettok
   of the distribution. (A simple echo "passwd")

Not absolutely necessary, but prooven to very practical and stable:

-) Dan Bernsteins wunderful daemontools package, please go and
   find it at <http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html> if you cannot find
   a packaged Version from your OS vendor.

This is our script:

   #!/bin/sh
   exec 2>&1
   exec setuidgid smmsp envdir env /etc/mail/wumi.py


Configure daemontools:
----------------------

-) the run script and the env dir contains all you need. Without
   daemontools you would have to setenv (or export) the values from
   env, each file is one environment variable. The script does not
   detach from the controlling terminal or parent process.

-) Select the socket to listen on and put it into the
   MI_UVSCAN_SOCKET environment variable, values are like
   "inet:25252@charon.wu-wien.ac.at".

-) Configure sendmail, we use a line like this in the .mc file:
   INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`uvscanmilter', `S=inet:25252@charon.wu-wien.ac.at, F=T,T=C:9m;S:9m;R:9m;E:9m')

Run it:
-------

-) Start the Wumi and the sendmail and enjoy: No Viruses and no
   dangerous attachments anymore.

Hint:
-----

-) We have success running the milter behind a balance proxy
   <http://sourceforge.net/projects/balance>, in order to distribute
   the load.

Enjoy!
